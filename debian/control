Description: Endless-specific and browser-related tools
 This currently provides a handler for webapp://<WM_CLASS>@<URI> URIs,
 which allows us to easily run chromium in application mode by specifying
 the desired WM_CLASS and final address to load in the URI.
 .
 As this handler gets installed in the OS, it can handle URLs loaded from
 unsandboxed environments (e.g. Facebook, WhatsApp) as well as those from
 sandboxed flatpak applications, that rely on the Flatpak's OpenURI portal.
 .
 If Google Chrome has been installed via the App Center (which requires
 having the eos-google-chrome-helper package installed), this script will
 consider using it instead of Chromium if it's set as the default browser,
 otherwise Chromium will be used.

Description: Google Chrome wrapper application
